## Drop Fake — Senior Gameplay Designer (Unannounced AAA Mobile Project)

- **Role:** **Senior Gameplay Designer**
- Unity · Mobile · Action/Fighting · Combat kits · FTUE · Data-driven · NDA

I design and implement combat kits and the systems that support them in Unity. I own features from early concept through playable prototypes, tuning, and handoff, partnering closely with engineers, animators, VFX, and production.

### Responsibilities

- Design combat kits and moment-to-moment interactions (identity, counterplay, clarity).
- Author data-driven content hooks and parameters for fast iteration and tuning.
- Rapid prototype in-engine to validate feel, readability, and timing.
- Structure FTUE and tutorial flow to teach mechanics through play.
- Coordinate cross-discipline implementation: animation timing, VFX clarity, and code hooks.

### Process & examples

1. Concept: define player goals and mechanical intent for a kit or feature.
2. Prototype: build a minimal in-engine implementation to test feel and readability.
3. Playtest & instrument: gather targeted feedback, playtest notes, and telemetry when available.
4. Tune: iterate parameters, animation windows, and feedback to reach clarity and balance.
5. Handoff: deliver concise design docs, tunable data, and implementation notes for engineers and content teams.

Examples: I built kit patterns (combo/cancel windows, defensive counters, simple resource rules) to make new characters faster to implement and safer to tune. I also redesigned the first-run FTUE sequence to introduce mechanics progressively and reduce early player friction.

### Selected contributions

- Implemented and tuned multiple combat kits; delivered repeated playtest-ready builds for internal validation.
- Built data-driven patterns and content hooks that shortened implementation time for new kits.
- Reworked onboarding and tutorial sequencing to improve early-session clarity.
- Produced concise design docs and implementation notes to speed handoff and reduce iteration friction.

### Outcomes & learnings

- Made kit implementation faster and more reliable through standardized patterns and clear handoff artifacts.
- Improved first-session clarity by restructuring FTUE, which reduced common early confusion in playtests (I can share specific metrics privately).

**Tools & workflow**

- Unity, spreadsheets/config-driven tuning, playtests, and short design docs for handoff.

**Note**

This project is unannounced, so I can't share footage or in-depth mechanics publicly; I'm happy to discuss process, tradeoffs, and specific contributions in private.
