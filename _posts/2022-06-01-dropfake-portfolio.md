## Hero / Intro

I'm a Senior Gameplay Designer at Drop Fake working on an unannounced AAA mobile action/fighting project built in Unity. I take features and character kits from paper design → implementation → iteration, partnering closely with engineering, animation, VFX, and production to deliver clear, responsive gameplay.

## Project Snapshot

- **Platform:** Mobile
- **Engine:** Unity
- **Focus Areas:** Combat kits, moment-to-moment feel, encounter readability, and onboarding/FTUE flows
- **Status:** Unannounced (details limited due to NDA)

## What I Owned

- Designed and implemented character combat kits from initial concept through playable prototypes and tuning passes.
- Built and iterated on combat systems/content hooks that support repeatable kit creation and fast balancing.
- Collaborated cross-discipline to align animation timing, VFX readability, audio beats, and gameplay rules.
- Contributed heavily to FTUE / tutorial design, structuring learn-by-doing steps and progression of mechanics.
- Supported lightweight production coordination: clarifying requirements, tracking dependencies, and unblocking iteration.

## How I Work

1. **Define the player goal** and the "why" behind the mechanic (clarity, counterplay, skill expression).
2. **Prototype quickly in-engine** to validate feel and readability early.
3. **Instrument iteration** with targeted feedback loops (team playtests, edge cases, balance checks).
4. **Polish for clarity:** remove ambiguity, ensure strong feedback, create consistent rules.
5. **Document and handoff:** maintain design docs and implementation notes so features scale.

## Collaboration

I work day-to-day with:

- **Engineers** to shape implementable systems and author content hooks
- **Animators** to align timing, cancels, hit reactions, and readability
- **VFX/SFX** to reinforce gameplay states and impact
- **Production** to plan deliverables and keep iteration moving

## Selected Outcomes

- Delivered multiple combat features and kit implementations through repeated iteration cycles.
- Improved onboarding clarity by restructuring tutorial steps and reducing early friction points.
- Helped standardize kit implementation patterns to make future content faster to build and safer to tune.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Combat kit design (identity, counterplay, clarity)
- Rapid prototyping and tuning in Unity
- Data-driven iteration
- FTUE/onboarding design
- Cross-discipline collaboration and delivery

## Tools

- Unity (including common sequencing/implementation workflows)
- Data-driven design patterns (content definitions, tunable parameters)
- Cross-discipline iteration workflows (docs, playtests, implementation notes)

## Note

Because the project is unannounced, I can't share footage or detailed mechanics publicly, but I'm happy to discuss my process, collaboration style, and the design tradeoffs I navigated.
