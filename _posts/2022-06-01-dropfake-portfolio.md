## The Game

I'm working with an all-star team of over 50 folks on a upcoming mobile game based on one of entertainment's biggest IPs. The project is currently under wraps!


## My Role

I'm working mainly in a combat design capacity. I take characters from initial concept to fully playable, balancing mechanical identity, pacing, and impact. I design RPG character kits, work closely with animators, engineers, and VFX artists to bring each character to life with depth and clarity.

In addition to combat systems, I’ve spent a good chunk of time deeply involved in First-Time User Experience (FTUE) design. Stemming from my interest in UX and product thinking, I collaborated with a small team to build a tutorial experience that's intuitive, engaging, and designed to retain players from day one.

In true startup fashion, I wear many hats. I'm nurturing some of my producer skills by helping manage task pipelines, coordinating across disciplines, and keeping the team moving efficiently through rapid iteration.
