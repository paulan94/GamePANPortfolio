## The Game - It's a secret! For now..

Here's what I can divulge though. We're creating a mobile game with an all-star team of game dev veterans! The project is still under wraps with an NDA in place. The game is based on a universally known IP and will offer a mix of PvE and PvP features. Players will be able to collect from a wide roster of characters and engage in a deep, skill based combat system layered with robust RPG progression.

## My Role - Senior Game Designer

I've worked on many different features here at Dropfake. Most of my time has probably been spent on designing, implementing, and iterating on character kits. I often flex my technical background by supporting others where I can. This includes debugging scripts, backend server data, and more.
I design and implement combat kits and the systems that support them in Unity. I own features from early concept through playable prototypes, tuning, and handoff, partnering closely with engineers, animators, VFX, and production.

### High Level Responsibilities

- Design combat kits and moment to moment interactions (identity, counterplay, clarity).
- Rapid prototype in-engine to validate feel, readability, and timing.
- Structure FTUE and tutorial flow to teach mechanics through play.
- Coordinate cross-discipline implementation: animation timing, VFX clarity, and code hooks.

### Process & examples

1. Concept: define player goals and mechanical intent for a kit or feature.
2. Prototype: build a minimal in-engine implementation to test feel and readability.
3. Playtest & instrument: gather targeted feedback, playtest notes, and telemetry when available.
4. Tune: iterate parameters, animation windows, and feedback to reach clarity and balance.
5. Handoff: deliver concise design docs, tunable data, and implementation notes for engineers and content teams.

Examples: I built kit patterns (combo/cancel windows, defensive counters, simple resource rules) to make new characters faster to implement and safer to tune. I also redesigned the first-run FTUE sequence to introduce mechanics progressively and reduce early player friction. I even added features to some of the in-engine tools to speed up pipeline inefficiencies.

### Selected contributions

- Implemented and tuned multiple combat kits; delivered repeated playtest-ready builds for internal validation.
- Built data-driven patterns and content hooks that shortened implementation time for new kits.
- Reworked onboarding and tutorial sequencing to improve early-session clarity.
- Produced concise design docs and implementation notes to speed handoff and reduce iteration friction.

## AI Usage

We use AI at Dropfake and I spend time outside of work to learn about AI and LLMs on personal projects. At Dropfake we rely on these tools for notetaking, code gen, idea generation, and more.

## **Note**

This project is unannounced, so I can't share footage or in-depth mechanics publicly; I'm happy to discuss process, tradeoffs, and specific contributions in private.
