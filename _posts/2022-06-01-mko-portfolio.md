## The Game

Mortal Kombat: Onslaught is a game that has been in the makings for 4+ years! It's a mobile gacha RPG where you collect your favorite heroes and create your own teams to participate in high octane PvE and PvP game modes. 


## My Role
I'm an associate game designer working on the combat team! I do most of my work implementing character abilities in UE5 Blueprints. I try to catch the near limitless edge cases when doing so, and work closely with other disciplines to ensure that each character is fleshed out to the desired AAA quality that Netherrealm Studios is known to produce.
