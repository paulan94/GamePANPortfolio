## The Game

Mortal Kombat: Onslaught is a game that has been in the makings for 4+ years! MK:O debuted on the Google Play store as #1 in the Free to Play category. It's a mobile gacha RPG where you collect your favorite heroes and create your own teams to participate in high octane PvE and PvP game modes. 


## My Role
I was an associate game designer working on the combat team! I did most of my work implementing character abilities in UE5 Blueprints. I tried to catch the near limitless edge cases when doing so, and worked closely with other disciplines to ensure that each character was fleshed out to the desired AAA quality that Netherrealm Studios is known to produce.
