## The Game

Mortal Kombat: Onslaught is a game that has been in the makings for 4+ years! MK:O debuted on the Google Play store as #1 in the Free to Play category. It's a mobile gacha RPG where you collect your favorite heroes and create your own teams to participate in high octane PvE and PvP game modes. The game was shut down in October 2024.

## My Role

I was an associate game designer working on the combat team! I spent most of my time (~70%) implementing character abilities in UE5 Blueprints. I spent the first few months working closely with veteran Designer Mick Pack- who showed me the ropes and gave me an amazing onboarding experience. (Thanks Mick for interviewing me and taking the time to properly onboard me!) My other work involved collaborating with other team members, playtests, creating internal and player facing documentation, and more. I also may have accidentally leaked some unreleased characters in my time there. Whoops.

Some of my favorite characters that I helped design and implement include:

- Cyrax
- MK1 Kenshi
- Cyber Smoke
- Klassic Kabal
- Peacemaker (Can't see me!)
