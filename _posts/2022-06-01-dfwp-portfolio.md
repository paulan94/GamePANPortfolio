## My Role

I was the designer and programmer for DFWP. In the design side, I designed the multiplayer combat, the main arena, environment, a modular weapon system, and a rewards system. This was a 2 person project, and our first networked game. We experimented with the Unity Mirror package before deciding on using Photon PUN for our networking solutions. I was responsible for a lot of the gameplay programming, but focused more on network programming.

## The Game
Deathfall Wolfpine is a 1v1 arena style PvP game, where two combatants fight in a best of 7 battle to the death! It features a modular weapon system, where each weapon can have a different hilt, pommel, and blade. We experimented with Unity's HDRP to create a game with higher graphics fidelity. However, as most people who try to make their first networked game will find, we had to dial back our scope until we eventually called it done. We learned a lot about which things should be handled client side vs server side, and were able to fight each other in real time.
