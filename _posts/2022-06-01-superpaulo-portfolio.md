## The Game
Super Paulo Man was my introduction into developing a 2d platformer game in Unity! You play as Paulo, running through the caves to save princess Plum! Be careful however, there are scary blobs, spike traps, and water that will slowly drown you if you sit idly by. 

## My Role
I was the sole developer of SPM! Most of my time was spent in designing meaningful levels that players could enjoy. I did 10+ playtest sessions with players across different skill levels to create the final iteration. To add a sense of urgency in the game, I created a rising tide of water in the 2nd level, that would kill the player if they collided with it. I spent a lot of time tweaking the player's speed and jump height to capture the feeling that I wanted. 

## Mistakes I made (and hopefully will learn from)
A big mistake that I made in SPM's development was creating the levels before I tweaked those player settings. In hindsight, I should have spent less time trying to create awesome levels at first, and focus on the speed/jump values more.
