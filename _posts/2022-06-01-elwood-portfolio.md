## The Game
Elwood was a prototype project that allowed me to get a grasp of what 3d development in Unity would be like. The player has access to a set of combat abilities, that they will use when in combat with enemies. Combat in Elwood is turn-based, and the player needs to be careful of patrolling enemies that might join in on an existing combat encounter to tip the scales in their favor.

## My Role
I wore multiple hats for this 2 person project. I did all of the level/environment designs, and most of the combat design. I iterated on the level design to create a meaningful linear progression for the player. Early on, they face an easy to kill enemy to ease the player into combat, and they work their way to more difficult monsters until they face the last boss. As is the case for all my projects, I had a major contribution to the programming of the project as a whole.


## Mistakes I made (and hopefully will learn from)
Unorganized/Inefficient code!!! A big problem we had in Elwood was related to project scope. There were far too many features that we wanted in our game that never saw the light of day. This was somewhat understandable since it was such an early project for us, but great to learn from.
