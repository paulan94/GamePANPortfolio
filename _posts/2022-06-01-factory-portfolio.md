## My Role
I was a game designer and programmer for Factory Reset. We had a team of 2 programmers, 2 artists, and 1 sound producer for this game jam project. My design focus was in systems/progression design. I spent a lot of my time iterating on the combat system, and trying to balance the two weapon types that they player could use. Another related challenge was in trying to balance various item stats against each other. After the game jam ended, I got the ok from my team to continue working on it solo, and updated the game for another 2 months.

## The Game

A steampunk ARPG style game! Play as Rusty, explore the garden, workshop, and make your way through a series of enemies, and test your skills against the final boss, Hammercrank!

Item drops are randomized, you have a 50-50 chance of getting either a sword or musket, with differing rarities (W,G,B,PRP,GOLD), as well as a item level that adjusts stat values of that item. 

At the workbench, you can recycle weapons to potentially get a stronger weapon, at the risk of getting an item with a lower rarity.
