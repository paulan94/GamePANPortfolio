## The Game

Factory Reset is a steampunk ARPG game! You play as Rusty, explore the garden, workshop, and make your way through hordes of enemies, and test your skills against the final boss, Hammercrank!

Item drops are randomized, you have a 50-50 chance of getting either a sword or musket, with differing rarities (W,G,B,PRP,GOLD), as well as a item level that adjusts stat values of that item.

At the workbench, you can recycle weapons to potentially get a stronger weapon, at the risk of getting an item with a lower rarity.

## My Role

I was a game designer and programmer for Factory Reset. We had a team of 2 programmers, 2 artists, and 1 sound producer for this game jam project. My design focus was in systems/progression design. I spent a lot of my time iterating on the combat system, and trying to balance the two weapon types that they player could use. Another related challenge was in trying to balance various item stats against each other. After the game jam ended, I got the ok from my team to continue working on it solo, and updated the game for another 2 months.

## Mistakes I made (and hopefully will learn from)

Checking my ego! In hindsight I should have collaborated more with my team members about the design decisions of our game. As the only designer on the team- I worked in a vaccum, quite limited to my own biases. My programming team(2) made design decisions as we implemented things. This resulted in some disjointed design choices and lack of clarity in combat and progression. UI/UX was another area that we mostly ignored. When it came time to judging our game- the judge didn't even realize we had a item and inventory system! It was a major core feature of our game that we spent weeks developing and fleshing out, but due to the lack of visual clarity it was fully missed.
