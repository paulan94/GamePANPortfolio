## The Game

Factory Reset is a steampunk ARPG game! You play as Rusty, explore the garden, workshop, and make your way through hordes of enemies, and test your skills against the final boss, Hammercrank!

Item drops are randomized, you have a 50-50 chance of getting either a sword or musket, with differing rarities (W,G,B,PRP,GOLD), as well as a item level that adjusts stat values of that item. 

At the workbench, you can recycle weapons to potentially get a stronger weapon, at the risk of getting an item with a lower rarity.


## My Role
I was a game designer and programmer for Factory Reset. We had a team of 2 programmers, 2 artists, and 1 sound producer for this game jam project. My design focus was in systems/progression design. I spent a lot of my time iterating on the combat system, and trying to balance the two weapon types that they player could use. Another related challenge was in trying to balance various item stats against each other. After the game jam ended, I got the ok from my team to continue working on it solo, and updated the game for another 2 months.

## Mistakes I made (and hopefully will learn from)
Checking my ego! No one on my team explicitly said anything about this to me, but in hindsight I should have communicated with my team members about how the design of our game should be. As we didn't have a explicit game designer on our team, my programming team(2) made most of the design calls as we implemented things. I should have reached out to some of our other team members for their design input, etc.
