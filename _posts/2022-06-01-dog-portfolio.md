## The Game
Play as Bao! An undercover pomeranian who is tasked with varied missions while his owners are gone on a very long grocery trip. The playing area is based on a real apartment and city in Southern California. Use the mailbox to receive messages from the Doggie President! 

In minigame #1, you must aim your potty stream well to advance the story!

In minigame #2, you must successfully take down the dog abuser with a **high powered sniper rifle!**


## My Role
I created dog (Bao Edition) in between jobs as a passion project. I gave myself a hard timeline of 1 month to design, develop, and iterate on this game. In the first week, I brainstormed and prototyped what the game might look like, what sorts of minigames I could have, and began mapping out my real-life apartment room. In the next two weeks, I created two minigames and worked on how I could make them replayable. The last week was focused on polish, and trying to tie in a simple linear narrative/quest system. My focus was to create minigames that were highly replayable.

## Mistakes I made (and hopefully will learn from)
I think I should've spent more time in designing a better camera in the "exploration" part of this game. There are instances where the player's camera clips through walls that may give an unpleasant experience. Another big issue was related to UI/UX and accessibility. A lot of the text/UI was poorly scaled, didn't account for color blindedness, and was not very pleasant to look at!
