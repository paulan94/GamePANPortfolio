## My Role
I created dog (Bao Edition) in between jobs. I gave myself a hard timeline of 1 month to design, develop, and iterate on this game. In the first week, I brainstormed and prototyped what the game might look like, what sorts of minigames I could have, and began mapping out my real-life apartment room. In the next two weeks, I created two minigames and worked on how I could make them replayable. The last week was focused on polish, and trying to tie in a simple linear narrative/quest system. My focus was to create minigames that were highly replayable.

## The Game
Play as Bao! An undercover pomeranian who is tasked with varied missions while his owners are gone on a market run. The playing area is based on a real apartment and city in Southern California. Score high on the minigames and unlock the next mission!
