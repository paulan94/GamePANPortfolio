description: Things I've noticed this year at GDC 2024 as a level 5 game developer
---

This was my second ever GDC, the first being last year. Tens of thousands of game developers and aspiring game developers from all around the world flock to San Francisco to share ideas, pitch new games, find funding, jobs, and much more. 

I couldn't put it into words during the week, but the notion of gate-keeping seems to be prevalent in the games industry. Some rightfully so, others not so much.

## Level 1 Game Developers

I imagine it now in the perspective of a young buck- looking to break into their first role. These people are the grunts- the level 1s in the industry. They have a lot of potential, soak up knowledge when led well, and some of these people will become legendary game developers. Unfortunately, they are in a tough spot given the current state of the gaming market all across the world. These people are "gatekept" in many ways.


### Gatekeeping the level 1s

- Young and Poor: These people are generally new to looking for work. As a result, many are not financially stable. They probably don't yet have too many financial responsibilities though, so they are a bit flexible here. Still, money gives access in many ways. I think the fact that GDC locks up their videos behind a vault is unfair. The level 1s need access to information, but need money to access that information. I was also told that over the years the lowest tiered pass become more and more restrictive. More gates for the level 1s!
- Find a Job: I audibly laugh out loud as I write this point. I spoke to 20~ students this year at GDC who were all looking for their first role. Their first lucky break. I think most of these people looking for jobs at this point know this by now but I'll mention it. Are you looking for an entry level role? There are multiple AAA veterans who just recently got laid off who also just applied to the role that you applied to. Competition is ROUGH! In consolation, I do believe there are companies out there that are looking to hire new blood- to mold them as I have mentioned before.


## Level 5 Game Developers

I think I'm around here now. No longer a basic grunt. I've got a few shipped games in my arsenal and have been working at a AAA for a year. I have a working understanding of the development life cycle and know how to collaborate with my peers. I'm taking it upon myself to mentor aspiring game developers and students so that they can learn from my mistakes and avoid some of the pitfalls I fell into. 

### Gatekeeping the level 5s

This is going to be more personal since I can speak to my own experiences. Other level 5s may have differing opinions. 
- Optics: I feel that sometimes I'm not taken seriously due to my lack of experience relative to those around me. When your peers have 10+ years of work designing games and 5+ years at your company, you might fly under the radar.
- Limiting Self-Belief: Tangentially related to the above point, you might find yourself struggling with imposter syndrome. Should I speak up? "Anything I can come up with is probably already obvious to the rest of the team.. best to keep quiet." I've thought that in my head at least a few dozen times in meetings. Sometimes it can be hard to speak up, but being comfortable in the discomfort is something that helps us grow as people- professional and personally.

## Level 10-100 Game Developers

These are high level developers who have been in the industry for ~10+ years. The roles that these people have are vital to the health of the industry. These should be gatekept and reserved for the best people suited for these roles. They know the ins and outs of the development cycle, are masters of their craft, and probably most importantly- are well connected in the industry. These people have probably already been burned one way or the other. Maybe they're dream game was cancelled, they might have been laid off a few times, or something worse. The point is they've stuck it through and kept that fire burning inside. These are the people we draw inspiration from. The ones that are leading the charge and mentoring the lower levels through their own trials.



As always, thanks for reading!
