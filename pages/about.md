# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a game designer for NetherRealm Studios- currently working on Mortal Kombat: Onslaught. I've previously worked as a software engineer at Meta, Boeing, and other startups. In my free time I like to work on creating my own games, learn martial arts, other languages, and many more. Thanks for coming to my portfolio page!
