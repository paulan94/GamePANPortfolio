# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a game designer for Drop Fake- currently working on secret project with an all-star team. I've previously worked as a game designer at Netherrealm Studios working on a mobile Mortal Kombat game, and as a software engineer at Meta, Boeing, and other startups. In my free time I like to work on creating my own games, learn martial arts, and other languages. Thank you for visiting my portfolio page.
