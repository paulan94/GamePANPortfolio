# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a Senior Gameplay Designer at Drop Fake, working on an unannounced AAA mobile project in Unity. I own character kit design and implementation from paper specs through playable prototypes and tuning, partnering with engineering, animation, and VFX to deliver responsive, readable combat. I've also contributed heavily to FTUE design—structuring tutorial flows that teach mechanics clearly and support early retention—plus cross-discipline coordination to keep iteration moving. I've previously worked as a game designer at NetherRealm Studios on Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, and as a software engineer at Meta, Boeing, and other startups. In my free time I like to work on creating my own games, learn martial arts, and study other languages. Thank you for visiting my portfolio page.
